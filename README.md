# Veracity Integration
The repository is about how to integrate your existing app with veracity platform. Currently, only ASP.NET core 2.0 is provided. More frameworks will be added in the future.

The identity and access management of veracity platform is fully based on Microsoft Azure AD B2C. Therefore, your app must obtain the configuration details for your app on Microsoft Azure AD B2C, which you can contact 8989@dnvgl.com (Global Service Desk of DNV GL) to help you with it.

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/CodeGx/veracity-integration/wiki) for the guide of integration.
