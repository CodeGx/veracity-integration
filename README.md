# Veracity Integration
The repository is about how to integrate your existing app with veracity platform. Currently, only ASP.NET core 2.0 is provided. More frameworks will be added in the future.
The identity and access management of veracity is fully based on Microsoft Azure AD B2C. Therefore, your app/service must obtain a specific client id and setup on Microsoft Azure AD B2C, which you can contact 8989@dnvgl.com (Global Service Desk of DNV GL) to create one.
